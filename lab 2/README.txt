Problem Description: Write a code in C to be run on the TI-C6713 processor for generating a sine wave of desired frequency.

To run the code type in the following commands on the Terminal window:

gcc a.c -lm                          # for compiling the code
./a.out		      # for  running the object file

RESULTS:

the array 'a' contains the samples of the sine wave sampled at 24000 Hz. The tone output can be heard using the mic jack on TI-C6713 board.
