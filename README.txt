This project contains Digital Signal Processing lab assignments, being conducted as a part of Electrical Engineering Lab-II at IIT Jodhpur.

Lab assignemnts have been grouped under different folders. Each folder conatins a lab_report.docx  file that contains instructions on how to run the code. The lab_report.docx file also describes the results obtained for different test cases.

Most of the assignments use a wav audio file as input that has been sampled at an appropriate frequency with 8-bits (usually unless mentioned otherwise) per sample. These input files can be generated using the "Audacity" software. The software can be downloaded free of cost from:
